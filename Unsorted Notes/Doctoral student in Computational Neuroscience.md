The doctoral student will be part of Dr. Kumar's research group. The research group uses computational and analytical methods to understand the dynamics and information processing in biological neuronal networks. The research in the Kumar lab is aimed at understading:

1.  The role of oscillations and correlations in communication between different brain areas    
	1. [[Portraits of communication in neuronal networks]]
2.  Control of brain activity dynamics 
	1. [[Recovery of Dynamics and Function in Spiking Neural Networks with Closed-Loop Control]]
3.  Interaction between neuron properties and network activity dynamics 
	1. [[From space to time. Spatial inhomogeneities lead to the emergence of spatiotemporal sequences in spiking neuronal networks]] 
	2. [[Dynamical state of the network determines the efficacy of single neuron properties in shaping the network activity]] 
	3. [[Computational Properties of the Visual Microcircuit]]
4.  Neural coding [e.g. Tauffer and Kumar 2020].

The research group is also developing mathematical models of brain diseases to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of disease related aberrant activity dynamics in brain diseases. More info.:Â [https://www.kth.se/profile/arvindku/](https://www.kth.se/profile/arvindku/)
