Interesting papers to read:
* [[Critical Branching Regulation of the E-I Net Spiking Neural Network Model]], a master thesis which simulated the E-I network in Nest and estimated the branching coefficient.
* [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] modeled a self-regulating brain. Appears to have very concrete ideas for why things are the way they are.
* [[Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant - A Scoping Review]] reviewed 25 years of research into the subject. It probably has a lot if interesting ideas.
* [[Emergent complex neural dynamics]] another meta-review which conclude that brain criticality is key for the emergence of complex neural dynamics.
* [[Self-Organized Supercriticality and Oscillations in Networks of Stochastic Spiking Neurons]] appears to mention Oscillations. I find this interesting, especially in relation to the Oscillations mentioned in that Quanta article.
