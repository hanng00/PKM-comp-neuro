**Hypothesis**
It posits that the brain is always teetering between two phases, or modes, of activity: 
* a **random** phase, where it is mostly inactive, 
* and an **ordered** phase, where it is overactive and on the verge of a seizure.
The hypothesis predicts that between these phases, *a sweet point exists* called **the critical point**, where the brain has a perfect balance of variety and structure. This state allows the brain to optimize multiple information processing tasks, from carrying out computations to transmitting and storing information, all at the same time.

The so called critical state may in fact be a [[Quasicritical State]]. The sweet critical point seems very similar to the concept of [[Flow]].

**Example**
Information storage are driven by the activation of neuron assemblies. 
* In a *subcritical* network, weak activites would not be able to form assemblies.
* In a *supercritical* network, strong activites would form a singleton.
* In a *critical* network, intermediate activites allowing assemblies to form, maximizing information storage.
This is very similar to the modularity of hypercolumns and minicolumns in [[BCPNN (Bayesian confidence propagation neural network)]].

**Mechanisms for establishing criticality**
See [[Mechanism for establishing criticallity]].

**Neurological responses to criticality states**
Research suggested that brain diseases are associated with failure to operate near the critical point or to return to it once pushed away. 
* If stayed in a supercritical state for too long,  [[Epilepsy]] occurs; 
* in a sub-critical state for too long, [[Comatose state]] occurs.

**Criticism**
* It is shown in [[Power-law statistics and universal scaling in the absence of criticality]] that power-law distributions can arise from randomized neurons, hence not being a good indicator of criticality.

**Future work**
* How does operating new the critical point affect cognition?
* How can external inputs drive a network to move around the critical point?
* [John Beggs](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Beggs) has a lot of interesting papers written on Critical Brain Theory.
