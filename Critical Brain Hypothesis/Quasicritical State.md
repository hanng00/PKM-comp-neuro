**Quasicritical State**
Two factors forcing the new definition of critical state:
* In statistical physics, criticality requires a system of infinite size. 
* There will always be pertubation that moves the system away from the fine-tuning.
Thus, a *quasicritical state* has been proposed. The system migrates around a broader but well-defined stable region. 

**The effects of the states**
* One model is to compare the brain to nuclear fission: 
	* a *supercritical* system would get lost in a frenzy of electrical activity, 
	* a *subcritical* would be like talking to someone who is asleep or drunk, 
* In a **critical** system, the neural network is *most sensitive to incoming signals*. A chain of active neurons allows information to spread from one brain area to another without dying prematurely or exploding. Very similar to the description of [[Flow]].
* In a **quasicritical system**, there exists background noise activity which disturbs the criticality. Very similar to how focusing one one thing creates the state of [[Flow]].

If the brain is truly critical, there would be a power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. One neuron should activate one other neuron on average.

**Is the quasicritical state symmetric?**
Scientists suggest that the brain is slightly subcritical. Being right at the critical point comes with the risk of tipping over.
* When enhanced focus is required, the brain would benefit from moving closer
* When faster, more intuitive response is required, moving further away would be beneficial.
In [[Inferring collective dynamical states from widely unobserved systems]], a new method for estimating the branching ratio found that rats, cats and monkeys all had a branching ratio of 0.98-0.99. Hence being slightly subcritical.

**Outlooks**
