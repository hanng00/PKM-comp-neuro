### Balance of excitation and inhibition
An excess of activity is mitigated by molecular mechanisms that inhibit the activity to bring it back down:
* Some experimental evidence suggests that when connections between neurons becomes stronger via repeated firings, this is counterbalanced by the weakening of other connections.
* This does not imply why the brain should work critically.

### Homeostatic plasticity
* Every neuran has a target firing rate, and the neuron adjusts its activity to maintain that target.
	* e.g. if the target is 1 fire/second but the neuron fires less often, it will increase its excitability meaning it will respond more strongly to and input until its firing rate rises to the target rate.
* This would let the brain "tune" its immense network of neurons to the critical point.

### Dynamical synapses
* Dynamical synapses where designed to have neurotransmitters being consumed when used, forcing it to regenerate before being able to use again [[_Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks]]. 
* Modeled in [[Scale free avalanches in excitatory-inhibitory populations of spiking neurons with conductance based synaptic currents]]
