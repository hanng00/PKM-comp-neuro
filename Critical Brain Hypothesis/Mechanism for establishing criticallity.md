### Homeostatic mechanisms in the brain
* The body keeps blood pressure, temperature and heart rate in a healthy range despite environmental changes via homeostatic mechanisms regulated by the [[Hypothalamus]]. 
* Similarly, brains naturally incline themselves to operate near the critical point as shown in [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] and [[Emergent complex neural dynamics]]

### Theory 1: *Balance of excitation and inhibition*
An excess of activity is mitigated by molecular mechanisms that inhibit the activity to bring it back down:
* Some experimental evidence suggests that when connections between neurons becomes stronger via repeated firings, this is counterbalanced by the weakening of other connections.
* This does not imply why the brain should work critically.

### Theory 2: *Homeostatic plasticity*
* Every neuran has a target firing rate, and the neuron adjusts its activity to maintain that target.
	* e.g. if the target is 1 fire/second but the neuron fires less often, it will increase its excitability meaning it will respond more strongly to and input until its firing rate rises to the target rate.
* This would let the brain "tune" its immense network of neurons to the critical point.
