* [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] modeled a self-regulating brain. Appears to have very concrete ideas for why things are the way they are.
* [[Adaptation to sensory input tunes visual cortex toÂ criticality]]  Our findings establish sensory adaptation as a self-organizing mechanism that maintains criticality in visual cortex during sensory information processing.
* Brains naturally incline themselves to operate near the critical point as shown in [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] and [[Emergent complex neural dynamics]]
