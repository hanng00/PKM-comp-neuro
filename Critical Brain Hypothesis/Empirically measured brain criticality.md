* [[Criticality between cortical states]] - measured brain criticality in anathesied rats. Unexplained data.
* [[Neuronal Avalanches in Neocortical Circuits]] - measured brain criticality by running electricity in brains of dead rats - explainable data.
* [[Cortical Circuit Dynamics Are Homeostatically Tuned to Criticality In Vivo]] - also measuring criticality in rats. Referred to by Beggs.
* * Brains naturally incline themselves to operate near the critical point as shown in [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] 
* Data from brains can only be explained by invoking criticiality, seen in [[Emergent complex neural dynamics]]
