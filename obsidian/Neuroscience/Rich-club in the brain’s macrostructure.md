### Takeaway
* Growing evidence supports that the brain has cores/hubs with critical roles. Theses require high energy but possess highly efficient neural information transfer. These are called the *rich-club*
* A review of the recent (2020) advantages in rich-club organization in the brain, mostly on how they are analyzed from a graph theoretical analysis.
