### Historical summary
* [[Self-organized criticality as a fundamental property of neural systems]] the holy bible of the field. (2014)
*  [[Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant - A Scoping Review]] reviewed 25 years of research into the subject. More a historical review, than what's up and coming.

### Review of existing models
* [[Self-Organization Toward Criticality by Synaptic Plasticity]] - discuss various biologoically plausable models operating across different timescales yields criticality.
* [[Mechanisms of Self-Organized Quasicriticality in Neuronal Network Models]] - reviews models yielding quasicriticality in neuronal network models.

### Experimental results
* [[How critical is brain criticality]] - a meta review from 2022 about recent data and progress. May give good insights into where the field is at.
* [[Self-Organized Criticality in the brain]] - gives a comprehensive review of the current progress and experimental results. (2021)
