Interesting papers to read:
* [[_Critical Branching Regulation of the E-I Net Spiking Neural Network Model]], a master thesis which simulated the E-I network in Nest and estimated the branching coefficient.
* [[Self-Organized Supercriticality and Oscillations in Networks of Stochastic Spiking Neurons]] appears to mention Oscillations. I find this interesting, especially in relation to the Oscillations mentioned in that Quanta article.
