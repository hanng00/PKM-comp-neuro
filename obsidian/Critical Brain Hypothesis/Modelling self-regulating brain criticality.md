## Thoughts
* The network must be large, with non-linear neurons as described in [[_Emergent complex neural dynamics]]. Models up until this point is too small and has complexity pre-built into the neurons.


## Recent work of models

#### Small scale, explicit models
**Hebbian learning**
* [[_Self-Tuned Critical Anti-Hebbian Networks]]. Modelled criticality using "anti-Hebbian" learning. Suggested self-criticality.
**Depressive synapses**
* [[_Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks]] altered a [[E-I Net model]] with activity-dependent depressive synapses. Interesting results with a simple assumption.
**Including learning**
* [[Unstable Dynamics, Nonequilibrium Phases and Criticality in Networked Excitable Media]] models a network showing spontaneous unstable dynamics and non-equilbirum phases resulting in 1/f noise.
*  [[_Critical Branching Regulation of the E-I Net Spiking Neural Network Model]] altered a [[E-I Net model]]. Reduced continous weights to ensure $\sigma=1$. Criticality was reached, but no optimized information processing. Could be that the scale was too small. 

### Statistical-physics inspired models
* [[Optimal dynamical range of excitable networks at criticality]] a network of excitable elements are shown to have its sensitivity and dynamic range maximized at the critical point of a non-equilibirum phase transition.

### Large scale, data-driven models
* [[Network structure of cerebral cortex shapes functional connectivity on multiple time scales]] - not mentioning criticality explicity, but appears to capture fMRI data good.
* Extensive reviews of complex dynamical networks are presented [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661304001901?casa_token=4FwrywE8-7MAAAAA:S0iJvQHvmZeX2E_3vya6uWRnTuuDT8i1u5kOKras6ha8N8mAByFOpKJYYzV0dc7U_hG4iVqoCzw) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2575), including **future challenges and possible research questions**. Examples of this is covered in [[fMRI data]].

* [[Adaptation to sensory input tunes visual cortex toÂ criticality]]  Our findings establish sensory adaptation as a self-organizing mechanism that maintains criticality in visual cortex during sensory information processing.
