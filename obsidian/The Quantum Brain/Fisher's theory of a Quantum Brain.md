It is hypothesised that the brain used qubits to function. This would 
explain the non-computatbility of the brain. In order for the quantum states to remain, external interference must be removed. Penrose propose that so called *microtubules* can uphold such quantum states.

**Quantum states in biological systems**
Quantum states are observed on scales of molecules, but never at the scale of biological systems. However, a [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3787) showed that quantum entaglement was used in photosynthesis.

**How the hypothesis grew**
1. Fisher became fascinated by how antidepressants actually worked in our brains. Lithium-7 is one such antidepressant, and the simplest molecular one. His question was:
	* *Would another isotope work, say lithium-6? (Lithium has 4 protons)*
	[Experiments showed](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/users/mpaf/Li_Isotope_1986_a.pdf) that rats given lithium-6 indeed showed much strongermaternal behaviors.
