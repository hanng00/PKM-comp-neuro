### Takeaway
**Claims that the power-law is not sufficient by itself to classify critical brain networks**

### Summary
The paper shows that aNN's with just a few thousand neurons can automatically generate power-law activity when measured in the right way; resembling data from brain studies. Despite the system not supposed to be critical. The power-law remained despite replacing the neurons with randomized neurons. He concludes that some other kind of test is needed. 

One such test could be the *susceptability* function in [[_Inferring collective dynamical states from widely unobserved systems]].

The author believes that neurons fire with such weak correlations that they fire almost randomly.
