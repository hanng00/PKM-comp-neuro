### Overview
The [[Free-energy minimization]] states that organisms seek to minimize the difference between expected sensory inputs and actual inputs. However, animals do not sit idle in dark corners - they live active lives. This papers adresses this contradiction.

### Relevant Information theory
* Information theory equates *generation of information* with *reduction of uncertainty* (surprise).
* Surprise must be defined relative to the organisms model of the world.
* This indicates a mathematical relation between adaption, mind and life, when equating informational uncertainty with physical disorder.

### Do room agents exist?
* The imperative: *avoid surprises and you will last longer*
* The agent will become an optimal model of its environment, consistent with the Good Regulator theorem stating that every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system.
* *Room agents can only exist if they can exist*. Appealing to the same tautology as in natural selection:
	* Why am I here? Because I have adaptive fitness
	* Why do I have adaptive fitness? Because I am here
* A dark-room will only yield low levels of surprise, if the agent has been optimized by evolution to predict and inhabit it. Agents that predict rich and stimulating environments will find the dark room surprising and leave it immediately.

### Historical path-dependence
* Then, how much of the cognitive architecture is to be explained by (1) direct appeal to the free-energy framework, and how much is determined by (2) messier processes of historical path-dependence?
* (2) emerges from interactions between ancestors - the model who could optimize the free-energy best survived.

### Disagreement
* The Philosopher disagrees that every cognitively imporant feature is a direct or indirect reflection of the free-energy minimization mandate.
