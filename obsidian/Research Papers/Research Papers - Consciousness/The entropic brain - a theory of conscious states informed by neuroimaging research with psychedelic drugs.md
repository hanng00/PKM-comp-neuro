### Introduction
**The hypothesis**
* *The entropic brain hypothesis* proposes that the quality of any conscious state depends on the system's [[Entropy]].
* Entropy allows us to translate between *mechanistic* (order vs. random) and *qualitative* properties (informational character, i.e. our uncertainty about the system if we were to sample it.)
	* Increased subjective uncertainty accompanies states of increased system entropy.
* These ideas align with [[Free-energy minimization]] principle.
**Perspective**: [[Self-Organized Criticality in the brain]]
* Three properties of SOC are of interest here:
	1. A maximum number of "metastable" critical states
	2. Maximum sensitivity to pertubation
	3. Avalanches
 * In which conscious states are SOC most pronounced?
**Perspective**: [[Freud's metapsychology]]
* Freud put forward a mechanistic description of *the ego*, and how consciousness arises from its cooperation and competition with other processes. This theory seems to have found the ego in the brain.
**Perspective:** [[The psychadelic drug state]]
* Neuromaging findings shows that
	* the psyschadelic state inhibits a higher-entropy state of consciousness.
	* more characteristics of criticality, than during normal waking consciousness.
