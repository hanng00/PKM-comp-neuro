**14/02-2023 - Discuss project scope**
---
Takeaways:
1. **Project plan** 
	1. Always mail submission directly to Pawel
	2. The research goal sounded good
	3. Feedback will be sent as mail.
	4. Maybe add the research question: *Which micro-scale mechanisms underlying/contributes to macro-scale ciriticality?*
2. **Iteration cycle 1**
	1. Pawel had limited experience with The Critical Brain Hypothesis
	2. Redoing the paper [[_Critical Branching Regulation of the E-I Net Spiking Neural Network Model]] is a good start to get acquainted with the field.
3. **Future iterations**
	1. Do my own research to understand where the field lies.
	2. Get to know existing Computational Models of critical states to acknowledge and build on.
4. **Other**
	1. Pawel heard on a conference about "Deco Rolls attractor network" (dynamical states about parts of the brain affecting monkey arm movement)
	2. Pawel away until the beginning of March, book meetings *after* that
