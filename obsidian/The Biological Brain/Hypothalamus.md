Your brain’s hypothalamus is the “smart control” coordinating center of your body. The hypothalamus is a structure deep within your brain. It recieves chemical messages from nerve cells in body and brain, and reacts to these to keep the body in a stable state of internal balance by either influencing the autonomic nervous system or by managing hormones.  
* Body temperature and blood pressure
* Hunger and thirst
* Sense of fullness when eating 
* Sex drive and mood

**Directly regulating the autonomic system**
The hypothalamus has direct access to regulate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.

**Regulating using hormones**
The hypothalamus works with the **pituitary gland** in two ways: 
1. Make two hormones and store them in the posterior pituitary.
	* When theses are needed, a signal is sent to the posterior pituitary to release them into the bloodstream.
	* These hormons are 
		1. **Oxytocin** (thought to play a role in human bonding, sexual arousal, trust, recognition, sleep cycle and feelings of well-being) and
		2. **Vasopressin** (regulates contorl of the body's water/urine volume and blood pressure).
		3. **Dopamine** - motivation and pleasure
2. Send signals (hormones) to the **anterior gland**, which in turns either releases hormones that directly affect the desired body parts or sends signals (hormones) to another gland to affect the body part.
	* Examples of these hormones are (signal -> sent out):
		1. **Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)** -> Growth hormones, stimulate long bones and big muscle growth.
		2. **Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)** -> Hormones to make testosterone, sperm production, menstrual cycle and egg release from the ovary
		3. **Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)** -> causes adrenal glands to release stress hormone cortisol and regulate metabolism and immune response
		4. **Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)** -> generate thyroxine controlling hwo much energy your body uses
