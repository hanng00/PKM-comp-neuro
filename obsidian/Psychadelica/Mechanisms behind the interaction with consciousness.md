### Thoughts
* For [[The brain structure - my hypothesis]], psyschadelica would mainly influence consciousness by relaxing the structure of the *global schema*. Maybe, the critical state of the brain is enhanced so that sensory inputs isn't processed automatically as easily - but rather experience immediatley. The experience is often compared to the ones that children have - an immediatey, comprehensive experience.
* This would explain the scientist in Micahel Pollan's book stating that "our consciousness is just one of many" - the global schema is just one configuration out of many.
* One person described that during the trip, the sensory inputs from the material world fades away - only to slowly fade back when the trip beings to end.
