### Thoughts

* One person described that when during the trip, when sensory inputs are faded out, there is a strong subjective will-power available. If a person *chooses* to relax in an anxious state, the experience is altered into a more relaxed state - and vice versa.

### Questions
* Set and setting are two important concepts in psychadelica. A bad setting makes it difficult to steer the experience via the subjective will-power. 
	* Is this because right before the trip kicks in, the brain is still reading in sensory inputs and emotions which affects the conscious state. Once the state is set, is it difficult to adjust and will be the main flavor of the experience?
