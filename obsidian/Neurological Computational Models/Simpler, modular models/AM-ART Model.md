Three layer neural network. 
* *Event-specific knowledge* is presented to the bottom layer $F_1$. 
	* Input sources are categorized into different brain sensories.
* a sequence of events are encoded into *life events* to the middle layer $F_2$
* which in turns encodes a sequence of related life events into *episodes* in layer $F_3$.
