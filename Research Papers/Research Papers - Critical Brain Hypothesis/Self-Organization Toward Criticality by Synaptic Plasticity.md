### Takeaway
* In this review, we discuss how various biologically plausible plasticity rules operating across multiple timescales are implemented in the models and how they alter the networkâ€™s dynamical state through modification of number and strength of the connections between the neurons. Some of these rules help to stabilize criticality, some need additional mechanisms to prevent divergence from the critical state. 
* We propose that rules that are capable of bringing the network to criticality can be classified by how long the near-critical dynamics persists after their disabling. Finally, we discuss the role of self-organization and criticality in computation.
