### Takeaway
This paper suggest five invariants that can be used to classify criticality from avalanches:
1. Timescale separation between the dynamics of the triggering event and the avalanche itself (this is demonstrated by the fact that the inverse-power-law density of avalanche sizes and lifetimes remain invariant to slow driving), 
2. Stationary avalanche size statistics despite wide avalanching-rate fluctuations, excluding non-homogeneous Poisson processes, 
3. The avalanche probabilities preceding and following main avalanches obey Omoriâ€™s law for earthquakes
4. The average size of avalanches following a main avalanche decays as an inverse power law and 
5. Avalanches spread spatially on a fractal.
