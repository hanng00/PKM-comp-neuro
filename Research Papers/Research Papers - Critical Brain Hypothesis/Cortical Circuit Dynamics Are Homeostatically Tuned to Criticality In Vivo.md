### Notes
* This paper *actually* takes into consideration the [[_Power-law statistics and universal scaling in the absence of criticality]] stating that power-law fitting **is not** sufficient to establish criticality. It proposes its own method called the exponent relation.

### Background
Text

### Research question
* To what extent is the cortex "critical" under normal conditions?
* Is criticicality a set point for cortical dynamics?
* Does firing rate homeostasis result in stable network properties?
