**Highlights**
* Visual cortical circuits _in vivo_ exhibit criticality, an ideal computational regime
* Monocular deprivation disrupts criticality prior to firing rate depression
* Criticality is actively re-established as firing rates are maximally depressed
* Models suggest inhibitory plasticity as a mechanism of a stable computational regime
