### The branching model
The video claims that *picrotoxin* surpresses inhibition neurons, while *AP5* surpresses excitation. Assuming that's the case, then these molecules should have an effect on anathesia and epilepsy.
* AP5 actually impaired learning in rats, as explored here: [[Synaptic plasticity and learning - selective impairment of learning rats and...]]
* Picrotoxin acts as a convulsant. In large doses, it introduce seizures and respiratory paralysis. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picrotoxin)
