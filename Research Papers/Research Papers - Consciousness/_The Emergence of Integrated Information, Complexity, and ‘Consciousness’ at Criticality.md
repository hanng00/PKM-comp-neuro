### Takeaway
* Integrated Information Theory posits that integrated information $\Phi$ represents the quantity of conscious experience.
* This paper models 159 random positively weighted networks analogous to small excitatory neural networks and computed $\Phi$.
* It was shown that $\Phi$ underwent a phase transition at the critical point in the model, measured as the peak of generalized susceptibility.
* At this point, $\Phi$ was maximally receptive and responsive to pertubations of its own states.

### Future work
$\Phi$ was computed on static networks. Future work could asses the role of evolutional dynamics on $\Phi$.
