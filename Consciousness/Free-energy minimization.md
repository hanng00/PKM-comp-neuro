### Overview
* The free-energy principle is nothing more than principle of least action, applied to information theory.
* It proposes that brain functions seeks to minimize free energy.

**Free energy**
In information-theory, *free energy* is defined as the difference between an organism's predictions about its sensory inputs and the sensations it actually encounters. It generalizes earlier concepts such as Bayesian Learning and Self-organization under the same umbrella.

### Critique
* Critique of the idea is adressed in [[_Free-energy minimization and the dark-room problem]]. It is not obvious to Philosopher, however, that every cognitively important feature of every such model (creature) will be a direct or indirect reflection of the free-energy minimization mandate. This is the missing element that Physicist (unlike Theorist) believes is implicit in the mathematics

### Future work
The free-energy principle should be unpacked in simulating and explaining adaptive behaviour and the perceptual inference upon which that behavior rests, such as:
* Categorization, synthesis and learning
* Action, perception of action and its understanding
* Attention, working memory, planning an exploration
