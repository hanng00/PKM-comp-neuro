### Overview
* We assume the brain's main work units consists of small subnetworks, so-called [[Rich-club in the brainâ€™s macrostructure]] - responsible for advance cognitive tasks. These process raw sensory inputs such as sound, taste, sight etc.
* These subnetworks are orchestrated by a global schema - almost like a control-tower at an airport. It connects acitivty between these regions. This is why two persons can hear the same sound (like a mean comment), but differ in how they react to it (acceptence or vigilance)

### What is driving the structure?
There are two ways in which the brain structure is driven:

**1. Sensory inputs**
* Whenever a sensory input is recieved, it triggers the rich-club responsible for handling the raw input.
* The *global schema* then handles this input and propagates it through the network, similarly to how a computer propagate input signals from mouse / keyboard.

**2. Spontaneous fluctuations**
* Spontaneous fluctuations, experimentally shown to persist in a multitude of configurations (anathesia, awake, sleeping, etc. in [[fMRI data]]), is what is called *the brain's default mode*. From what I understand, it yields consistent activations of neurons in an irregular pattern
	* TODO, add source to the above statement of irregular/asynchr. patterns.
* Regarding the Spontaneous fluctuations (described in [[fMRI data]]), I'm hypothesising that:
	* During the day, the fluctuations are the initiating spark for the global schema. Almost like the coldness appearing during summer, initiating complex bird formations to fly south.
	* During the night, new connections that were formed during the day are *reinforced* when the spontatneous fluctuations pass through these connections.
	* Stronger spontaneous fluctuations may also create day-dreaming?

### Psychological predictions
**1. Focus and ADHD**
People with ADHD have hard time focusing. This could be explained by them having more intense *default mode.* Spontaneous thoughts occur because it is stronger than the sensory inputs. Taking Ritalin (dopamine) enhances the power of the global schema.
