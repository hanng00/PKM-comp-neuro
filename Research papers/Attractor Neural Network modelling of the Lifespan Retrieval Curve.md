**Aim and scope**
This paper aims at modelling the reminiscence bump from the [[Reminiscence bump]] to predict how biological parameters affect its form. 

The paper uses the [[BCPNN (Bayesian confidence propagation neural network)]] learning process, in a modular [[Attractor Memory Network Model]], to study the effect of altering synaptic plasticity parameters.

It assumes long-term memory exists, and does not model the transfer from  short-term memory which the [[Memory Chain Model]] or [[AM-ART Model]] does.
