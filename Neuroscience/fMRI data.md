### Spontaneous fluctuations
**Observations**
* Spontaneous BOLD fluctuations are not random noise. It is consistent across different resting states, including sleep and anasthesia. Suggesting it is an intrinsic propery of the brain, as opposed to being activity evoked by mental activity. [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2201)
* Spontaneous BOLD fluctuations do not dissappear durign taks paradigms but continue throughout, contributing to inter-trial variability in measured BOLD reponses and behavior.[Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2201)

**Data analysis**
* An image-based activation network analysis of thousands of separate activation maps extracted out covarying networks in the resting brain. The major brain networks (and decompositions into subnetworks) show close correspondence with the active brain dynamics. [Link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0905267106)
* The connectivity dsitribution followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. The clustering suggests the brain is a combined small-world and scale-free organization.

### Induced unconsciousness and natural sleep
* When inducing propofol, the [[Rich-club in the brainâ€™s macrostructure]] was switching of between high-order cognitive and sensory and motor networks - similarly for natural sleep. [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32018124/) 
* But, they appear to differ. Induced unconsciousness acts from a top-down approach, but natural sleep from a bottom-up approach.

### Mental disorders
* The default-mode network is altered in the presence of mental disorders. [A meta-review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763408001504?casa_token=Ag3sILD7ecwAAAAA:LDvfJEZA-TOrah4zo_zBbIlNTtg7uHhp7trCA9XrniXljfOwGKxM_akFakPhHOltIW_gO041kFs) of multiple studies compared brain scans for autism, schizofrenia, ADHD, epilepsy, anxiety, depression etc.
* [Alzeimers Disease paper](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/28/18/4756.full.pdf) about default mode.
* [Schizophrenia paper](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/ajp.2007.164.3.450) about default mode.
* [Epilepsy paper 1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.20323) and [Epilepsy paper 2](https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021919?casa_token=Q-uOzpGBvJYAAAAA%3AE1FJbkkBqCRP7M3iw9t9DzQIFIHfSZaLW1nQxVHVdWhmthjgs4WL9RlKHv1OWZAeqXnw7nq3nKXpnHo) about the default mode.
