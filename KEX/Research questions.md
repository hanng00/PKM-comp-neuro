### Idea 1
Big idea:
* According to [[Criticality between cortical states]], new data from a rat brain under anathesia can not be explained using the existing critical brain framework.
* According to [[_Brain Criticality - Optimizing Neural Computations]], molecules such as AP5 surpress excitatory inhibitors, causing brain activity to slow.
* Explore if the synapses from [[_Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks]] can explain the new data, by adding some type of surpression on synapses in the excitatory neurons - simulating anathesia on rats. 

Additional thought:
* What if statistical physics is the answer, as suggest by [[_Emergent complex neural dynamics]]?

### Idea 2
Construct some of the existing models, as described in [[Modelling self-regulating brain criticality]], and compute the effect on metrics such as:
* Compute Integrated Information Theory $\Phi$ on dynamical neural models, suggested by [[_The Emergence of Integrated Information, Complexity, and ‘Consciousness’ at Criticality]].
* Information processing capability, such as was done in the [[_Critical Branching Regulation of the E-I Net Spiking Neural Network Model]] but for other critical models.

### Idea 3
How does the default mode affect learning? Does it reinforce learning? Is that why sleep is so important? Just like training a muscle.

### Idea 4
* A lot of theories are proposed in [[Mechanisms behind the interaction with consciousness]] and [[Subjective will-power]] in relation to [[The brain structure - my hypothesis]]. Is it possible to use a brain model which includes background noise, and simulate the hypothesis?

### Idea 5
1. Fit SINDy to fMRI data
2. Estimate the emergent entropy. Does it increase with network size?

### Flow
1. Compare self-regualting networks based on optimal information transportation
2. - || -, based on IIT




**TODOs**
1. Read [[Criticality between cortical states]] to understand how the mice data was derived. See if it is possible to build a model which explains that.
2. Read [[Scale free avalanches in excitatory-inhibitory populations of spiking neurons with conductance based synaptic currents]] and compare with the biological synapses from [[_Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks]]. Are the techniques the same for building a self-regulating brain?
3. Compare AP5 and proctexin from [[_Brain Criticality - Optimizing Neural Computations]]. Are their effects on neurons similar to anathesia drugs etc.?
4. Read [[The Critically Tuned Cortex]] where Beggs review new results. Formulate explicit research questions on where to continue working. Or read on Beggs latest research questions.

### Build a model explaining the data recorded from mice
[This article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/do-brains-operate-at-a-tipping-point-new-clues-and-complications-20190610/) claims that [[Criticality between cortical states]] recorded data, for which the current models of criticality cannot explain.

The critical point **did not** fell between phases of low and high neuronal activity. Instead, the critical point separated a phase in which neurons fired synchronously and a phase characterized by largerly incoherent firing of neurons.
