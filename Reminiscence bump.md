Older people tends to recognize more memories from their 10s-30s than more recent periods. I think this is because neurons are more active during those ages.

An effect in the long-term memory, which is established via neuron ensambles generated through long-term potentiation and depressions.

**Possible explanations**
*Psychological*
* When encountered with situations lacking stability, more mental work is required to cope. This leads to greater encoding and thus better recall. At younger ages, you lack experience and every situation are chaos-like. Additional bumps are seen during traumatic periods for migrants.
* Younger ages is when you reproduce, which requires you to be on your feet.
* At those ages, you create your life-script. The root of you identity today, hence you recall them easier.
*Neurobiological*
* Decrease of brain plasticity with aging, decreasing dopamine receptors and pruning synapses.

**How is such a curve even measured?**
* *Galton cue-word technique* - say a list of cue words, count the time of recall an note the distribution of lifespan
