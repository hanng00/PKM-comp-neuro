**Definition**
A mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyement in the process of the activity. It is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time.

It is the melting together of action and consciousness. It requires full mental concentration, but should be effortless.

Named by the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975.

**Mechanism**
One's mind can only attend a certain amount of information, Csíkszentmihályi estimated it to be [110 bits of information per second](https://lateralaction.com/articles/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/). But a lot of that is dedicaded to simple daily tasks, such as decoding speech taking 40-60 bits of information.

When in a flow state, all of the available bits are dedicated towards **one** task, losing all awareness of all other things (time, people, distractions).
